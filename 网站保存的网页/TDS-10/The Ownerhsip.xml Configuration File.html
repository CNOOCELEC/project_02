            <h2>The ownership.xml Configuration File</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>Although it does many different things, the primary purpose 
                    of the ownership.xml is to define ownership rules. The 
                    ownership lock-out system operates in the operator tool 
                    screens, rather than on the controller. That is, the 
                    controller doesn’t care who writes to it. The operator 
                    screens determine whether it’s possible to write values to 
                    one controller or another. The ownership.xml configures the 
                    ownership rules.</p>
                <p>The ownership.xml file should be the same on every 
                    controller on a rig. It should be placed in the /varco/www/
                    directory.</p>
                <p>The root of the ownership.xml file can have two attributes 
                    that define the customer and rig names. These are used by 
                    the servlets to show the customer and rig names on the 
                    service index page.</p>
                <pre><code>
  &lt;config customer='...' rig='...'&gt;

  ...

  &lt;/config&gt; 
                </code></pre>
                <h3>SBCs</h3>
                <p>One thing that the ownership.xml defines is the tool 
                    controller machines that the operator screens can talk to. 
                    The first section in the ownership.xml defines the SBCs 
                    (tool controllers):</p>
                <pre><code>
  &lt;config customer='...' rig='...'&gt;
    &lt;sbc id='...' ip='...'/&gt;

    ...
                </code></pre>
                <p>Each SBC on the network must have an entry in the 
                    ownership.xml file. In the past, this information was used 
                    only by the operator screens. However, now this information 
                    is read by the j9.sh script on the Linux tool controller 
                    machines when the machine is starting up. The j9.sh 
                    script actually sets the IP address of the tool controller 
                    machine using the information in the ownership.xml file. 
                    The script reads the screen tool name from the 
                    admin_config.xml file and compares it with 
                    the list of SBCs in the ownership.xml file. When it 
                    finds an id that matches the screen tool name, the 
                    corresponding IP address is read from the ownership.xml 
                    file and assigned to that machine.</p>
                <p>The id attribute is a human-readable name. This name will 
                    not appear in the operator screens, but it must match the 
                    screen tool name (which will appear as the tool name on 
                    all of the service screens). Therefore, the id must be 
                    legible. By convention, we do not use abbreviations like 
                    “PRS1.” Instead, we want names like “Fore Racker.” Spaces 
                    are allowed.</p>
                <p>The ip attribute is the IP address of that machine, e.g., 
                    “192.168.31.20.” </p>
                <h3>Network Mask and Gateway</h3>
                <p>The next section in the ownership.xml defines the network 
                    net mask and gateway:</p>
                <pre><code>
  &lt;config&gt;
    &lt;sbc id='...' ip='...'/&gt;
    ...
    &lt;sbc id='...' ip='...'/&gt;

    &lt;network netmask='...' gateway='...'/&gt;

    ...
                </code></pre>
                <p>Because the j9.sh script defines the IP address of the 
                    machine that it runs on, it also needs to know the net 
                    mask and gateway. This information used to be in the 
                    /etc/network/interfaces file.</p>
                <p>The netmask attribute is typically “255.255.255.0.”</p>
                <p>The gateway attribute is typically “192.168.31.1” (for 
                    IP addresses in the 192.168.31.... range).</p>
                <h3>HMIs</h3>
                <p>The next section in the ownership.xml defines HMI ownership 
                    groups:</p>
                <pre><code>
  &lt;config&gt;
    &lt;sbc id='...' ip='...'/&gt;
    ...
    &lt;sbc id='...' ip='...'/&gt;

    &lt;network.../&gt;

    &lt;hmi ip='...' group='...'/&gt;

    ...
                </code></pre>
                <p>This change applies to www 1.6.0 to 1.7.0 only. The “hmi” 
                    tag was introduced as a way to assign ownership groups to 
                    devices with specific IP addresses instead of having to 
                    put an id.txt file on that device. If an HMI runs a web 
                    browser that runs the operator screens, for example, that 
                    HMI would be identified as one of the driller’s HMIs by 
                    an id.txt file in the /varco directory on the hard drive 
                    of that device that contained the word “Driller.” As of 
                    www 1.6.0, the id.txt file does not need to be on the 
                    driller’s HMI as long as there is an entry in the 
                    ownership.xml file that specifies that the HMI 
                    (identified by its IP address) has the group “Driller.”</p>
                <p>In practice, however, even in www 1.6.x, the “hmi” tags 
                    were never used. The id.txt file was never removed from 
                    HMIs. The “hmi” tag can usually be safely removed from 
                    the ownership.xml file.</p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>The next section in the ownership.xml defines the tools: </p>
                <pre><code>
  &lt;config&gt;
    &lt;sbc id='...' ip='...'/&gt;
    ...
    &lt;sbc id='...' ip='...'/&gt;

    &lt;network.../&gt;

    &lt;hmi.../&gt;
    ...
    &lt;hmi.../&gt;

    &lt;tool name='...' host='...' url='...' ownership='...'/&gt;

    ...
                </code></pre>
                <p>Each SBC can host more than one tool. For example, the 
                    auxiliary SBC might have a cathead, a power slips, and a 
                    rotary table. The operator screens are organized around 
                    tools only and essentially ignore SBCs.</p>
                <p>The name attribute is the name of the tool. Again, by 
                    convention, we prefer to spell these out (e.g, “Rotary 
                    Table” instead of “RST”). The names have to be readable 
                    by humans. Spaces are allowed, but the names have to be 
                    short so that they can fit on buttons in the operator 
                    screens.</p>
                <p>The host name in the tool element must correspond to the 
                    name of an SBC. That is, it must match the “id” attribute 
                    of one of the sbc elements above. This indicates which 
                    SBC hosts the tool. This information will be used to look 
                    up the IP address of the machine that is responsible for 
                    the tool.</p>
                <p>The url attribute is a little confusing. Most often, its 
                    value is “/operator/,” but on SBCs that host multiple 
                    tools, it is quite often something like “/operator/RotaryTable/.”
                    The original idea was that when one visited a screen for 
                    a tool, that one would know the name of the tool by 
                    looking at the directory inside of /varco/www/operator 
                    that the screen appeared in. Screens for the rotary table 
                    would be in /varco/www/operator/RotaryTable, for example. 
                    However, the operator screens don’t need to detect the 
                    tool in that way. The operator screens detect the tool 
                    when the operator selects it. But this attribute is still 
                    important. It is used by the OwnershipManager, an ownership 
                    class that is part of the controller code, but which is 
                    actually used by the operator screen applet. The 
                    OwnershipManager uses this information to work with the 
                    controller’s ControlStationMediator to figure out the names 
                    of the ownership web objects. For example, on most tools, 
                    there will be a web object named OpenStation.owner, where 
                    the name of the current tool owner can be found; in the 
                    ownership.xml, one would indicate that fact by setting the 
                    url to “/operator/.” However, on the auxiliary, the name 
                    of the current tool owner for the rotary table tool would 
                    be contained by the web object named 
                    “OpenStation.RotaryTable.owner,” so the url for the rotary 
                    table tool in the ownership.xml would have to be 
                    “/operator/RotaryTable.”</p>
                <p>The ownership attribute actually specifies the level of 
                    ownership that applies to that tool. The two most common 
                    values for this attribute are “exclusive” (meaning that 
                    only specific, named operators can control the tool at 
                    one time—see the “groups” below) and “none” 
                    (meaning that everyone has simultaneous access to the 
                    tool at any time). A control station without ownership 
                    of an “exclusive” tool cannot write to the tool. There 
                    is a third possibility, “any,” that would allow any 
                    control station to own a tool, but only one can own 
                    the tool at any one time.</p>
                <h3>Ownership Groups</h3>
                <p>The next section of the ownership.xml file lists the 
                    ownership groups:</p>
                <pre><code>
  &lt;config&gt;
    &lt;sbc id='...' ip='...'/&gt;
    ...
    &lt;sbc id='...' ip='...'/&gt;

    &lt;network.../&gt;

    &lt;hmi.../&gt;
    ...
    &lt;hmi.../&gt;

    &lt;tool.../&gt;
    ...
    &lt;tool.../&gt;

    &lt;group name='...' service_screens_visible='...'&gt;
      &lt;allowed tool='...' enablerInput='...' disabledMessage='...'/&gt;
      ...
      &lt;allowed tool='...'/&gt;
    &lt;/group&gt;

    ...
                </code></pre>
                <p>The group specifies an ownership group and the list of 
                    exclusive tools that the group is allowed to own.</p>
                <p>The group name attribute is the name of the group. This is 
                    typically something like “Driller” or “Remote.” The concept 
                    is that usually an operator will have more than one HMI. 
                    All of the driller’s HMIs will be in the “Driller” group, 
                    so they will all function the same way with regards to 
                    ownership. This group name is the name that gets written 
                    to the controller’s OpenStation.request web object, and 
                    appears back in the OpenStation.owner web object and will 
                    appear as the name of the owner in the ownership button on 
                    the screen. It is also the name of the local group 
                    identifier in the operator screen communication logs. Also, 
                    the HMI identifies itself as this group by a file called 
                    /varco/id.txt which must be written to the HMI itself.</p>
                <p>The service_screens_visible attribute is optional. If it 
                    appears, it is most likely going to say 
                    “service_screens_visible='T'” because the default is false. 
                    If this is set to “T,” then there will be an extra button 
                    on the operator screen’s tool utilities menu for that 
                    station that will allow the operator to navigate to the 
                    service index page. Usually, we want one station to be 
                    able to do this, but not the driller or assistant driller.</p>
                <p>The allowed tool attribute specifies one tool that this 
                    ownership group is allowed to own. These would typically 
                    be the tools specified above with ownership='exclusive.' 
                    These have to be names that appear in the tool elements 
                    above.</p>
                <p>The enablerInput is optional. It specifies the name of a 
                    WebObject whose value would have to be true in order for 
                    ownership to be enabled for that tool for that group. This 
                    allows hard-wired lockout switches or E-stop switches 
                    (like on multi-chair drawworks stations) to interlock the 
                    ability to take ownership, and to cause ownership to be 
                    lost if the switch position changes.</p>
                <p>The disabledMessage is another optional field associated 
                    with the enablerInput. If ownership is lost or disabled 
                    because of the enablerInput, this message will show up on 
                    the screen to explain what happened. This should be a very 
                    short message (one word or two).</p>
                <h3>Ownership Exclusions</h3>
                <p>The next section in the ownership.xml is the exclusions:</p>
                <pre><code>
  &lt;config&gt;
    &lt;sbc id='...' ip='...'/&gt;
    ...
    &lt;sbc id='...' ip='...'/&gt;

    &lt;network.../&gt;

    &lt;hmi.../&gt;
    ...
    &lt;hmi.../&gt;

    &lt;tool.../&gt;
    ...
    &lt;tool.../&gt;

    &lt;group/&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/group&gt;

    &lt;exclude&gt;
      &lt;excluded tool='...'/&gt;
      &lt;excluded tool='...'/&gt;
    &lt;/exclude&gt;

    ...
                </code></pre>
                <p>There are some tools that cannot be operated by an operator 
                    at the same time. For example, a control station typically 
                    will have only one joystick. The drawworks requires a 
                    joystick and so does the racker. We do not want the 
                    operator to own the drawworks (and send joystick commands 
                    to it) at the same time that the operator owns the racker 
                    (and send joystick command to it at the same time). So, 
                    we exclude the possibility that the operator can own both 
                    at once. There can be any number of exclusions and any 
                    number of tools in a single exclusion group.</p>
                <p>The tool attribute has to be a name that matches the one of 
                    the names in the tool elements above.</p>
                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>The next section in the ownership.xml file is the 
                    navigation section. This is a single element by itself that 
                    is distinct from the other elements at the root level of 
                    the ownership.xml file.</p>
                <pre><code>
  &lt;config&gt;
    &lt;sbc id='...' ip='...'/&gt;
    ...
    &lt;sbc id='...' ip='...'/&gt;

    &lt;network.../&gt;

    &lt;hmi.../&gt;
    ...
    &lt;hmi.../&gt;

    &lt;tool.../&gt;
    ...
    &lt;tool.../&gt;

    &lt;group/&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/group&gt;

    &lt;exclude&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/exclude&gt;

    &lt;navigation&gt;
    ....
    &lt;/navigation&gt;

  &lt;/config&gt;
                </code></pre>
                <h3>Navigation: Pre-configured Tool Buttons</h3>
                <p>The navigation section is used exclusively by the operator 
                    screens applet to configure navigation buttons on the 
                    operator screens menu. It has several subsections of its 
                    own. The first of these is the list of pre-configured 
                    tool buttons:</p>
                <pre><code>
  &lt;config&gt;
    ...
    &lt;navigation&gt;
      &lt;pre_configured_tool_buttons&gt;
        &lt;button name='...'&gt;
          &lt;tool name='...'/&gt;
          ...
          &lt;tool name='...'/&gt;
        &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/pre-configured_tool_buttons&gt;
    &lt;/navigation&gt;
  &lt;/config&gt;
                </code></pre>
                <p>The pre-configured tool buttons section is optional. If you 
                    don’t include it, then the operator screen system will have 
                    two buttons to the left of the “Alarms” button: “My Tools” 
                    and “Other Tools” The menu for the “My Tools” button 
                    includes the tools that the operator station is allowed 
                    to own. The menu for the “Other Tools” button includes 
                    the tools that the operator station can see but cannot 
                    own. These are determined by the list of allowed tools 
                    in the ownership groups above.</p>
                <p>If the pre-configured tool buttons section is included, 
                    then the “My Tools” and “Other Tools” buttons do not 
                    appear. In their place are whatever buttons are specified 
                    in the pre-configured tools.</p>
                <p>The button name attribute will determine the main of the 
                    button on the main tool bar in the operator screens. You 
                    should try to limit the number of button elements to one 
                    or two. You might be able to crowd three in there, if you 
                    need to.</p>
                <p>The tool name attribute will determine the name of a tool 
                    button in the menu of the main button. The names of the 
                    tools in the tool elements all have to match names of 
                    tools defined in the ownership.xml file. There is a 
                    limit to how many tools you can have. The limit has 
                    to do with how much screen real estate each tool button 
                    takes up. The operator screen menu bar will break up a 
                    list of tools into two columns of buttons, so you might 
                    be able to fit about twenty tools.</p>
                <p>If you have a tool that you don’t have screens for, you can 
                    just leave it off of the lists of pre-configured tool 
                    buttons and a button for it will not appear.</p>
                <p>By convention, we would like these tools to be be in 
                    alphabetical order.</p>
                <h3>Navigation: Process Screens</h3>
                <p>The next section in the navigation element is the list of 
                    process screens:</p>
                <pre><code>
  &lt;config&gt;
    ...
    &lt;navigation&gt;
      &lt;pre_configured_tool_buttons&gt;
      ...
      &lt;/pre-configured_tool_buttons&gt;

      &lt;process_screens&gt;
        &lt;screen name='...' url='...' isDefaultHomeScreen='...'/&gt;
          &lt;involved_tools&gt;&gt;
            &lt;tool name='...'/&gt;
            ...
            &lt;tool name='...'/&gt;
          &lt;/involved_tools&gt;
        &lt;/screen&gt;
      &lt;/process_screens&gt;
    &lt;/navigation&gt;
  &lt;/config&gt;
                </code></pre>
                <p>The process_screens sections is optional. You should include 
                    it if you have process screens. A process screen is most 
                    strictly defined as a screen that has to talk with more 
                    than one tool. However, any screen associated with any 
                    tool can talk with more than one tool. For example, the 
                    racker operator screen talks with both the racker and the 
                    fingerboard tools.</p>
                <p>Usually, in a process screen, each data field includes the 
                    name of the tool that it needs to get data from or write to, 
                    as opposed to a screen that is tool-specific, where it will 
                    just write to the tool that it came from.</p>
                <p>For our purposes, a process screen is essentially a single 
                    screen that acts like a tool. A button for a screen listed 
                    in the process_screens section will appear alongside the 
                    other tools in the tool menu.</p>
                <p>The url should list the full path name of the screen 
                    document, like in “/varco/www/operator/drilling_overview.xml.” 
                    This should be the same on every SBC. The same document 
                    should appear in the same place on every SBC.</p>
                <p>The isDefaultHomeScreen attribute is optional. Typically, 
                    it’s only there if the value is “T,” since there isn’t any 
                    other reason to have it in there. A process screen that 
                    is marked with this attribute will have its own button 
                    appear on the main tool bar and will not appear in the tool 
                    menu. In www versions before www 1.7.4, only one of the 
                    process screens could be the default home screen. In www 
                    1.7.4, any number of process screens can be marked as 
                    “default home screens” and they will appear in the main 
                    navigation tool bar in the operator screens.</p>
                <p>The involved_tools section is not optional. Each tool 
                    element in the involved_tools must list one of the tools 
                    that the process screen talks to. If all of the tools that 
                    the process screen talks to are offline, then the button 
                    for that process screen will be disabled. If any one of the 
                    tools is online and available, then the button for the 
                    process screen will be enabled.</p>
                <p>The names of the tools in the involved_tools section need 
                    to all be defined in the tools section of the ownership.xml.</p>
                <h3>Navigation: System</h3>
                <p>The next section of the navigation element is the system 
                    element:</p>
                <pre><code>
  &lt;config&gt;
    ...
    &lt;navigation&gt;
      &lt;pre_configured_tool_buttons&gt;
      ...
      &lt;/pre-configured_tool_buttons&gt;

      &lt;process_screens&gt;
      ...
      &lt;/process_screens&gt;

      &lt;system button_name='...'&gt;
        &lt;tool name='...' color='...' default='...'&gt;
          &lt;link name='...'&gt;
            &lt;link name='...' url='...'/&gt;
            ...
            &lt;link name='...' url='...'/&gt;
          &lt;/link&gt;
          &lt;link name='...' url='...'/&gt;
        &lt;/tool&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/system&gt;
    &lt;/navigation&gt;
  &lt;/config&gt;
                </code></pre>
                <p>The system element is required. It lists the navigation 
                    menu buttons for each tool screen for each tool.</p>
                <p>The system button_name attribute is optional and probably 
                    unnecessary. It lets you name the tool button. On the 
                    main menu bar, there will be one button that is 
                    dedicated to the tool whose screen is currently showing. 
                    The name of that button is the name of the tool that is 
                    currently selected. Before the operator selects a tool, 
                    the name of this button is “This Tool” by default.</p>
                <p>Inside the system element, there will be one tool element 
                    for each tool on the rig that has screens. It’s possible 
                    to leave a tool out of this section and its button will 
                    not appear.</p>
                <p>If you do not have a list of pre-configured tool buttons 
                    (see above), then the menu of tool buttons will be in the 
                    order in which they appear in the “system” section here.</p>
                <p>By convention, we would like these tools to be be in 
                    alphabetical order.</p>
                <p>The color attribute is unnecessary. You can leave it out. 
                    At one time, we thought we wanted to distinguish between 
                    tools by giving each tool a different color in 
                    its navigation buttons. We don’t do that anymore. All of 
                    the navigation buttons are dark blue.</p>
                <p>The default attribute is the full path name of the default 
                    screen for that tool. That is, when the operator first 
                    navigates to a tool, we want some screen for that tool 
                    to show up right away on the screen. This is how we 
                    specify what that screen will be. Typically, it’s the 
                    main operator screen for the tool. Also, we usually want 
                    a link to that tool in the list of links below it.</p>
                <p>The links elements, in www 1.7.4, are sort of optional. 
                    It is standard practice to build a separate configuration 
                    file, /varco/www/operator/nav_config.xml file, to configure 
                    the navigation links on the operator screens for each tool. 
                    The syntax of that file is the same as it is in the system 
                    element in the ownership.xml. It is easier to configure 
                    the nav_config.xml file for each tool instead of trying 
                    to coordinate among several tool designers to put that 
                    information in a single ownerhsip.xml file that needs to 
                    be the same on every controller.</p>
                <p>The link elements can be used in two ways. The name 
                    attribute becomes the name of a navigation button. A 
                    link that contains just a name and includes a list of 
                    other links will produce a sub-menu for that tool button. 
                    A link that contains a name and a url attribute is a button 
                    that will allow the operator to navigate to a screen.</p>
                <p>The url attribute is the full path name of the screen file 
                    on the SBC.</p>
                <h3>Navigation: System: MSI or V-DAQ</h3>
                <p>The MSI or V-DAQ requires special handling. 
                    Because these tools do not have operator screens as we know 
                    them, they can’t be treated as one of our tools in the system 
                    element of the ownership.xml file. The MSI or V-DAQ entry 
                    has to look like this:</p>
                <pre><code>
  &lt;tool name='MSI' varco_tool='F' vdaq='T' url='/servlet/com.varco.cp.Servlet.OperatorScreensServlet'/&gt;
                </code></pre>
            </div>
