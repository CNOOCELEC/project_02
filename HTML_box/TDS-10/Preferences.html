            <h2>Preferences and www 1.7.4</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>What are Preferences?</h3>
                <p>It’s fairly common in modern applications to take advantage 
                    of an operating system’s “preferences” feature. For example, 
                    if you open a word processing or spreadsheet application, 
                    it’s usually possible to find a list of recently-opened 
                    documents. That list is saved by the operating system to 
                    persistent storage, so that when you open the application 
                    again, the information is still there. Applications are 
                    designed to save common settings like colors, tool choices, 
                    unit system choices, etc. so that you only have to set 
                    these things up once and they are remembered, so that 
                    when you open the application again, the settings are 
                    already there and you don’t have to set them up again.</p>
                <p>The Amphion preferences system works like that. It provides 
                    a way to save settings and information to persistent storage 
                    between application sessions. Starting in www 1.7.0, every 
                    time the operator screens are started up, they participate 
                    in a system that includes every controller and every other 
                    instance of the operator screens on the local network. The 
                    operator screens share information among themselves and 
                    store this information on the controllers. A bit of 
                    information—a “preference”—is nothing more than a name 
                    (a String object), an array of bytes (which could be 
                    anything), and a number that indicates some kind of 
                    “freshness”—or how recently the array of bytes was 
                    last updated. The intention of the preference system 
                    is to make sure that the most recent version of the 
                    information (the array of bytes) is kept the same 
                    between every instance of the operator screens, and 
                    is stored on every controller. If the information 
                    changes on one screen, then the change needs to be 
                    broadcast to every other operator screen and also 
                    stored on every controller. If you close down one 
                    operator display and start it back up again, the 
                    information should still be there. If you close down 
                    all the operator displays and start them back up again, 
                    that information should still be there. And that’s all 
                    that the Amphion preference system does.</p>
                <p>We created the preference system because a specific application, 
                    the SDI system, wanted to have state information stored between 
                    operator sessions. The operator screen that looks at graphs of 
                    logged data also uses the preferences system to store its 
                    “pen sets.” It’s so that when the operator sets up the data 
                    graph to look at some set of data, and then closes the data 
                    graph, the same information will be stored and will be there 
                    the next time they open the data graph.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Problems with Preferences</h3>
                <p>We use the preferences system to store system-wide 
                    configuration information. So, there is a potential 
                    problem with trying to insure that the rig configuration 
                    is the same everywhere.</p>
                <p>The problems that we have had with the preferences system are 
                    that it doesn’t work well enough, and that it works too well. 
                    It is supposed to maintain consistency of information. So, 
                    when it doesn’t work well enough, then the information is 
                    not consistent between instances of the operator screens. 
                    When it works too well, then the information is kept 
                    consistent no matter what we do to try to change it.</p>
                <p>One of the basic principles of the Amphion system is that 
                    it must be designed as a peer-to-peer system with no 
                    single point of failure. So, there is no single storage 
                    device (no server) where information can be stored. If 
                    we are to have a consistent set of information, then 
                    that information must be consistently stored on every 
                    controller. If one or more controllers are switched off 
                    when the others get an information update, then the 
                    information is not consistent. </p>
                <p>The consistency among preferences has to be maintained by 
                    the operator screens (strictly speaking, the preferences 
                    system is part of the applet communications system, but 
                    the operator screens are the only part of the www that 
                    fully exercises that system).</p>
                <p>What usually happens is that the operator screens typically 
                    get their information from a single controller (whichever 
                    controller the web browser is pointed to when it gets the 
                    operator screens page). When one screen starts up, it will 
                    read the preferences from that one controller, so which 
                    preferences you get will depend on which controller it 
                    starts up from. In www 1.7.3.2 and earlier, the preferences 
                    would be automatically sent to every controller. In www 1.7.4, 
                    it won’t automatically propagate the preferences to all the 
                    others, but still, the preferences that you get will depend 
                    on which controller it starts up from.</p>
                <p>A more common problem is that the operator screens keep a 
                    copy of the information. If we update the information and 
                    save it to the controllers, but then the operator screens 
                    automatically write their (outdated) information down to 
                    the controllers, they will overwrite the information that 
                    we want. We have had some difficulty making sure that the 
                    information gets sent to the operator screens at the same 
                    time that we send it to the controllers. Hopefully, we have 
                    fixed this in www 1.7.4.</p>
                <p>Still, the best way to insure that preferences are updated is 
                    to make sure the operator screens are not running anywhere, 
                    and then update the preferences.obj file in /varco/data/persistent/ 
                    on all the controllers. In the versions of www 1.7.x before 
                    1.7.4, this can be done through the preferences configuration 
                    applet or by just replacing the actual file. In www 1.7.4, 
                    it’s better to use the preferences configuration applet, 
                    because replacing the file may not actually change anything.</p>

                <h3>Ownership Groups, Roles, and Profiles</h3>
                <p>Prior to www 1.7, an operator HMI was associated with an 
                    ownership group. We would specify the ownership group on an 
                    HMI by including a small text file on the machine itself, in 
                    /varco/id.txt. This file was to contain the ownership group 
                    name for that HMI.</p>
                <p>An ownership group was specified in the ownership.xml file, 
                    which is the configuration file that specifies which tools 
                    can be owned by which ownership groups. For example, we might 
                    want the driller to be able to control the drilling tools like 
                    the top drive and drawworks, while the assistant driller might 
                    control pipe handling tools like the racker and fingerboard. 
                    So, we make an ownership group “Driller” and another “AD” which 
                    we can use to identify who gets to own what.</p>
                <p>The ownership.xml file was originally intended to specify who 
                    gets to own what, and whether there were any ownership 
                    exclusions or enablers. An example of an ownership exclusion 
                    is that we only want the driller to operate either the 
                    drawworks or the racker, but not both, because both use the 
                    same joystick. An enabler is used when we have something like 
                    a hard-wired switch which can be used to lock out one person 
                    or another from owning a tool like the drawworks. The 
                    ownership.xml file was later expanded to specify all of the 
                    operator screen navigation options as well. And then, even 
                    later, many of the operator screen navigation options, at 
                    least for individual tools, moved into the nav_config.xml file.</p>
                <p>The problem with the id.txt file to specify ownership groups 
                    is that we have to configure it on every HMI. If an HMI is 
                    replaced, then someone needs to go in and specially configure 
                    its id.txt file. HMIs are usually designed to run off of 
                    read-only compact flash cards, so making a permanent change 
                    like that can be difficult. Plus, it’s fairly easy to fool 
                    the system into thinking that anyone is the driller. </p>
                <p>We realize that we needed to expand the concept of an ownership 
                    group for the sake of alarms. It has been a long-term goal to 
                    update the alarm system to allow for different people to 
                    receive different kinds of alarms. For example, a maintenance 
                    person might need to see an alarm that some piece of equipment 
                    is due for service. However, we don’t want the driller to see 
                    that alarm because it would be an unnecessary distraction. In 
                    order to manage this, we need to be able to build a concept of 
                    different roles into the system. We need to be able to tell the 
                    software that there is a maintenance role that is different 
                    from the driller role, for example, in order to direct the 
                    appropriate alarms to the appropriate people.</p>
                <p>In www 1.7, we expanded the concept of the ownership group 
                    into the concept of a role. A role has permissions to be 
                    able to do and see various things. A role can have permission 
                    to view screens, take ownership of a tool, view alarms, etc. 
                    for individual tools. It can also have permissions that apply 
                    to the role itself, like the ability to navigate to the service 
                    pages from the operator screens and the ability to use the 
                    online Widget Editor to change screens.</p>
                <p>In addition, the role contains permissions which control some 
                    of the options in the zone management system. For example, 
                    we sometimes want to have buttons on the zone management 
                    screen to allow the operator to take and release ownership. 
                    Sometimes, we don’t. The algorithm for figuring this out 
                    depends on how many operator chairs there are. However, 
                    the software cannot pop up a periscope and count the number 
                    of chairs it sees. It counts chairs by looking at tool names. 
                    If the chair tools are named “Driller Chair” and “AD Chair,” 
                    then we can easily determine how many chairs there are. 
                    However, if the chairs happen to be named “Driller Console” 
                    or something like that, then the software will not be able 
                    to properly count them. Counting chairs, for the software, 
                    is and error-prone process. Instead, we tried to build that 
                    into the role so that a rig designer can easily add or remove 
                    the ownership buttons on the zone management screen. It’s a 
                    similar situation with deciding whether to add lock-out and 
                    override buttons on the zone management screen: there are 
                    rules for it, but they can be fooled. We wanted some person 
                    to be able to change those options, if needed.</p>
                <p>Plus, if we ever have a role like “Maintenance,” we probably 
                    want to be very specific about what sort of permissions we 
                    give that person.</p>
                <p>In practice, the only roles that we use are the same ones that 
                    appear as ownership groups in the ownership.xml file: the 
                    driller, assistant driller, and remote station. However, 
                    if we are ever going to include the more comprehensive alarm 
                    system, we have to start somewhere. </p>
                <p>We typically have two sets of tool buttons in the operator 
                    screens: one for the driller and one for the assistant driller. 
                    In practice, both menus tend to take up all of the available 
                    menu space and both contain nearly all the same tools. But, we 
                    needed to do this because we might someday need to run assistant 
                    driller’s tools from the driller’s chair, or vice versa. It makes 
                    more sense to have a button on the screen that would allow us to 
                    simply switch roles, so that if we’re in the driller’s role, we 
                    get the driller’s tools, and if we need to be the assistant 
                    driller for a while, we can switch to that role.</p>
                <p>However, we don’t necessarily want anyone to be able to switch 
                    into any role. Some operator consoles have a line of sight to 
                    the drill floor, and some don’t. We do not want someone on a 
                    remote console to switch into the driller’s role and start 
                    moving tools around. For this reason, we also have profiles.</p>
                <p>While a role corresponds to a person’s job, a profile corresponds 
                    to an HMI or a group of HMIs. We expect that if the driller has 
                    three HMIs, all three will have the same driller profile. This 
                    is a further expansion on the ownership group concept. A profile 
                    is allowed to take on specific roles. A driller HMI profile, 
                    for example, might be able to take on the driller or assistant 
                    driller’s role. A remote HMI profile might be able to take on a 
                    maintenance role or a “company man” role or something similar. 
                    We might like some roles to be relatively restricted and require 
                    a password in order to enter them.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Assigning Profiles</h3>
                <p>Before www 1.7, we essentially assigned a profile and role 
                    (actually, an ownership group) to an HMI using the id.txt file. 
                    In www 1.7, we started to assign profiles to HMIs through a 
                    different means.</p>
                <p>Each Ethernet adapter card has a unique identification number. 
                    In Java version 1.6, we can read this identification number and 
                    use it to uniquely identify every HMI. We can then store an 
                    association between this number and a profile name, which 
                    allows us to effectively assign a profile to every HMI.</p>
                <p>In www 1.7.2, when the HMI started up, we would read the 
                    Ethernet identification number and pop up a dialog box to 
                    ask the operator to assign a profile to it. The dialog box 
                    was supposed to show up only once, when it was first powered 
                    up on the network, and then the setting would be remembered. 
                    It’s a relatively simple system, except that we discovered 
                    that an HMI often has more than one Ethernet adapter and we 
                    had no guarantee that we would get the same Ethernet 
                    identification number every time we started up. So, we 
                    would sometimes have an HMI coming and ask to be assigned 
                    a profile multiple times.</p>
                <p>In www 1.7.3, we track every Ethernet identification number on 
                    an HMI and associate a profile name with the whole group so 
                    that we can more reliably remember which profile the HMI 
                    belongs to. At the same time, we gave each HMI a “name” 
                    which was simply the string of characters that corresponds 
                    to one of the Ethernet identifier numbers. These tended to 
                    be long strings with a lot of “%” signs in them and they 
                    weren’t very human-readable.</p>
                <p>In www 1.7.4, we tried to make several improvements. First, we 
                    want to give HMIs human-readable names. When an HMI comes on 
                    the network for the first time, we need to assign it a profile 
                    and give it a name. Second, for some rather obvious security 
                    reasons, we want to make sure that not anyone can assign any 
                    profile to any computer. Third, after consulting with a 
                    friendly commissioning engineer, we created a special HMI 
                    commissioning mode, which does allow anyone to assign any 
                    profile to any computer, and to do it every time the HMI 
                    starts up, but only while the system is in that mode.</p>
                <p>We want the HMIs to have human-readable names because of 
                    another feature that we added in www 1.7.4, which is the 
                    ability to remotely monitor the operator screens. There 
                    is a remote monitoring system which allows someone to view 
                    the operator screens (not the service pages) of essentially 
                    any HMI from a station that might be on or off the rig. In 
                    order to know what HMI we are looking at, it would be helpful 
                    if the HMIs were named something like “Driller HMI 3,” for 
                    example, instead of a string of odd characters.</p>
                <p>In normal mode, when an HMI starts up on the network for the 
                    first time, a dialog box pops up to allow the operator to 
                    assign a profile. There is a space to input the HMI name, 
                    and a list of possible profiles to select from. An on-screen 
                    “international” (mostly European) standard keyboard is provided 
                    so that a name can be entered on a touch-screen.</p>
                <img src="./Preferences_files/profile_request_dialog_01.png" width="339" height="510" alt="Profile Request Dialog" style="float:left; margin:10px">
                <p>Notice that there is a special profile, Read Only. This profile 
                    does not appear in any profile lists that the web browser. It 
                    is what it looks like. It allows the operator to view the tools 
                    using the operator screens, but not to write anything to the 
                    controllers. The screen navigation menu that comes with the 
                    Read Only profile will be a duplicate of the one defined for 
                    the driller profile. If there is no driller profile, then the 
                    navigation menu will be randomly determined.</p>
                <p>Because we don’t want anyone to be able to assign any profile to 
                    any HMI (workstation), the dialog above allows the operator to 
                    request a profile. But there is another step. The profile 
                    request needs to be confirmed. If the profile is not confirmed, 
                    then it will be read-only. Again, this is in normal mode, not 
                    HMI commissioning mode.</p>
                <p>After the operator presses the OK button, the dialog to confirm 
                    the profile pops up.</p>
                <img src="./Preferences_files/confirm_profile_dialog_01.png" width="347" height="246" alt="Confirm Profile Dialog" style="float:right; margin:10px">
                <p>To confirm the profile, the appropriate password (ProfileAdmin) 
                    needs to be entered in the text field. Once the profile is 
                    confirmed, it will be associated with the HMI automatically 
                    from that point on. The dialog boxes should not appear again.</p>
                <p>Once the profile is requested, the association between the 
                    profile and the HMI is saved to the preferences system, but 
                    as an unconfirmed profile. If we don’t know the password, we 
                    can just close the Confirm Profile dialog and we will be 
                    allowed to see the operator screens using the requested 
                    profile, but we will not be able to write to any controller 
                    with it. This is how we prevent just anyone from plugging a 
                    laptop into the rig network and becoming the driller.</p>
                <p>The read-only profile is automatically confirmed, and the 
                    confirmation dialog will not pop up.</p>
                <p>There is an alternate way to confirm a profile. In the 
                    preferences configuration applet, available from a link 
                    on the main service page, the Workstation tab includes a 
                    check-box that allows us to confirm the profile.</p>
                <img src="./Preferences_files/pref_config_workstation_confirm_01.png" width="729" height="546" alt="Preferences Configuration Workstation confirm page" style="margin:10px">
                <p>After we put a check mark in the check-box we need to save the 
                    configuration to the controllers so that it can be remembered 
                    the next time we start up the HMI.</p>
                <p>This screen is also where we can remove profiles that aren’t 
                    confirmed or that are no longer relevant (like the laptop 
                    of a rig technician who has left the rig, for example).</p>

                <h3>HMI Commissioning Mode</h3>
                <p>In HMI commissioning mode, things are a little different. A 
                    slightly different dialog pops up, but for the same purpose.</p>
                <img src="./Preferences_files/hmi_settings_dialog_01.png" width="433" height="503" alt="HMI Commissioning Mode dialog" style="float:left; margin:10px">
                <p>In HMI commissioning mode, this dialog always pops up, 
                    whenever the HMI comes on the network. This is because we 
                    understand that commissioning engineers like to swap HMIs 
                    from one position to another, and like to be able to use 
                    any HMI to accomplish any task. In HMI commissioning mode, 
                    whatever profile is selected becomes the confirmed profile 
                    for that HMI until it is changed. The confirmation dialog 
                    will not pop up. Once we leave HMI commissioning mode, the 
                    assignments that we last had will be the ones that are 
                    remembered by the system.</p>
                <p>HMI commissioning mode is the default, so when www 1.7.4 is 
                    first installed, it will be in HMI commissioning mode until 
                    a commissioning engineer switches it off. To switch HMI 
                    commissioning mode on or off, there is a check box on the 
                    System tab of the preferences configuration applet.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Back to the ownership.xml File</h3>
                <p>Even though the new configuration system allows us to make 
                    some interesting changes in how rig software is configured, 
                    no one has really used it. In fact, the “preferences” system 
                    tends to be very unpopular. In www 1.7.4 we are introducing 
                    an alternative, which is to allow the rig software to use 
                    the ownership.xml file. In this mode, no “preferences” need 
                    to be configured. The system will build its configuration 
                    by reading the ownership.xml file every time the operator 
                    screens start up, as it did before www 1.7. In fact, in 
                    www 1.7.4, this is the default mode. We can switch this 
                    mode on and off using a check box on the system tab of the 
                    preferences configuration applet.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Installing Preferences</h3>
                <p>In www 1.7.x versions before 1.7.4, it worked reasonably 
                    well to edit the preferences.obj file with the offline 
                    editor and then copy the file to the /varco/data/persistent/ 
                    directory on all the controllers. With www 1.7.4, this might 
                    not work as well.</p>
                <p>We have had cases where the preferences file seems to get 
                    corrupted. We don’t know how this happens, but in an effort 
                    to prevent it, we have included a “Preferences” servlet in 
                    www 1.7.4. This servlet acts as a buffer between the 
                    preferences.obj file and the outside world. It reads 
                    the file and stores a copy of its contents internally. 
                    When an applet asks for the preferences, the information 
                    comes from the servlet’s internal storage, not from the 
                    preferences.obj file itself. Also, when preference changes 
                    are written to the controller, they are written to the 
                    internal storage on the Preferences servlet, which can 
                    then write the changes to the preferences.obj file when 
                    it has time. This should prevent multiple applets from 
                    trying to write to the preferences.obj file at the same 
                    time. In theory, this should prevent corruption by 
                    preventing multiple sources from accessing the file 
                    at the same time.</p>
                <p>What this means is that the best way to install preferences 
                    in www 1.7.4 is to open the online preferences configuration 
                    applet, load or edit any preferences file that you like 
                    (it has a lot more options, including the ability to load 
                    from a specific controller or from a file on a laptop), and 
                    then use that to save to the network. And although it’s less 
                    likely that there will be a problem with HMIs writing their 
                    version to the network at the same time, it is still 
                    recommended that we turn off all the HMIs while changing 
                    the preferences file, if this is possible.</p>
                <p>When you save to the network from the preferences 
                    configuration applet, a dialog appears asking you to 
                    confirm the controller addresses to write to. The problem 
                    that this tries to address is that when the preferences 
                    configuration applet starts up, it tries to find 
                    controllers on the network to write to. However, 
                    this process takes time. If we start up the preferences 
                    configuration applet, change a single check box (for 
                    example), and then try to write preferences to the 
                    network, the applet may not have had time to find 
                    all the controllers on the network. It will only 
                    write to the controllers that it knows are available, 
                    and these may not be all the controllers.</p>
                <img src="./Preferences_files/select_controllers_01.png" width="563" height="465" alt="Preferences Configuration save controllers dialog" style="margin:10px">
                <p>When this dialog pops up, take a moment to look at the 
                    controllers that it thinks are available. If there are 
                    some that you know are online, but it doesn’t, then check 
                    the box next to that controller to get it to write to 
                    that address.</p>
                <p>Also, the preference configuration applet gets the list 
                    of controllers on the network from the preferences or 
                    from the ownership.xml file. This list may be inaccurate. 
                    If there are controllers on the network that are not listed 
                    in the preferences of ownership.xml file, then the 
                    preferences configuration applet may not know about 
                    them at all. Check the list when it comes up. If there 
                    are controllers missing, then you may need to use a 
                    second menu item in the preferences configuration applet 
                    that allows you to write to specific IP addresses.</p>
                <p>Never write preferences to a VDAQ or MSI controller 
                    because those controllers use an earlier www and they 
                    will not understand.</p>
                <p>Also, in www 1.7.4 we have eliminated most of the processes 
                    that automatically write configuration data to the 
                    preferences system. In www versions earlier than 1.7.4, 
                    the operator screens would periodically write preference 
                    data to all controllers, which made the information 
                    difficult to control. In www 1.7.4, this should never 
                    happen. The only time the configuration is written to 
                    any controller is when the operator specifically asks 
                    for it or authorizes it.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Integrity and Consistency Checks</h3>
                <p>In www 1.7.4, we also have integrity and consistency checks 
                    for preferences. The integrity check tries to read 
                    preferences from the raw byte data. If it fails, then 
                    the operator should get a dialog box to let them know 
                    and the preference data will go no farther into the 
                    system. The system will not try to load 
                    corrupt preferences.</p>
                <p>In HMI commissioning mode, when the operator screens are 
                    started up, the system will wait for a full minute, and 
                    then read the preferences from various controllers and 
                    compare them to each other. If any inconsistencies are 
                    found, it will show a dialog box to let the operator 
                    know. This will not appear in normal operating mode.</p>
