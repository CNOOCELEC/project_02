            <h2>How to Clear Caches</h2>
            <p>A common problem is that the computers that we use to run the 
                operator screens and other applets can keep older copies 
                of the application files in memory, in a cache. The purpose 
                of the cache is to keep a copy of the application files 
                locally, so that they do not need to constantly be 
                downloaded. The problem is that when the cached files 
                change (because of an upgrade of the www version, for 
                example), the web browser may not be able to tell that 
                it needs to download a new set of files. It may keep 
                the older files in memory and try to use those. This 
                will result in crashes and other problems.</p>
            <p>There are two places that a Windows computer might 
                be caching older files. </p>

            <h3>Web Browser</h3>
            <p>Go to Windows control panels and find the Internet Properties 
                control panel. This might also be accessible from Internet 
                Explorer (pull down the Tools menu and select Internet Options).</p>
            <p><img src="./Clear Caches_files/internet_options_01.png" width="492" height="660"></p>
            <p>Make sure there is a check in the check box “Delete browsing 
                history on exit.”</p>
            <p>Click on the “Delete...” button. This will bring up a dialog box.</p>
            <p><img src="./Clear Caches_files/delete_browsing_history_01.png" width="468" height="595"></p>
            <p>Make sure there is a check mark in the check box “Temporary 
                Internet files.” The other check boxes can be unchecked. Then 
                click on the Delete button.</p>
            <p>Also, in the Internet Options dialog, click on the Browsing 
                History: Settings button. This brings up the dialog to 
                control temporary Internet files and history settings.</p>
            <p><img src="./Clear Caches_files/temporary_internet_files_01.png" width="443" height="593"></p>
            <p>Make sure the button indicates that we want to check for newer 
                versions of stored pages every time a web page is visited.</p>
            <p>Click OK to exit the Temporary Internet Files and History 
                Settings dialog.</p>
            <p>Click OK to exit the Internet Options dialog.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>Open the control panel for Java.</p>
            <p><img src="./Clear Caches_files/java_general_01.png" width="452" height="569"></p>
            <p>In the General tab, click on the Settings button in the 
                Temporary Internet Files section. This will bring up a 
                dialog box.</p>
            <p><img src="./Clear Caches_files/java_temporary_files_01.png" width="488" height="392"></p>
            <p>Make sure that there is no check mark in the check box to 
                “Keep temporary files on my computer.”</p>
            <p>Click on the “Delete Files...” button. This brings up 
                another dialog.</p>
            <p><img src="./Clear Caches_files/java_delete_temporary_files_01.png" width="317" height="244"></p>
            <p>If the option to delete files for applications and applets is 
                available, select it and click OK.</p>
            <p>Click OK to exit the Temporary Files Settings dialog.</p>
            <p>Click OK to exit the Java control panel.</p>
